# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Vector Database with Chunking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: LangChain and Ollama mentioned due to explicit user requirement constraint, acceptable
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - Resolved: File size limit set to 100MB with performance note
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - Success criteria focus on user-facing metrics (time, accuracy, workflow completion)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - Acceptance criteria provided in user stories for each requirement
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - P1: Processing and querying (core functionality)
  - P2: Configuration (operational flexibility)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Technology mentions in dependencies due to explicit user requirement

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
